    <h4><p>Georges has always been inspired by items that are 
      accumulated over time, gathering rocks, and pieces of iron. 
      He formulates a plan of integration for these itemas and mixes 
      them with plants and local foliage, adding a solar power source and 
      pump and creates beautiful meaningful pieces. </p>
      
      <p>He started creating custom designs in 2022 during the pandemic and his
      vision has expanded to include custom sculptures of various beloved 
      dogs or pets and shapes that are of interest. He has built fountains
      for others as part of a collaborative effort to share beautiful
      water features that are personalized and would like to extend this 
      service to new customers.</p>
