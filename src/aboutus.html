    <column-2><h2>Starting this project has always been a dream</h2>
    <h4>Georges has always been inspired by items that are 
      accumulated over time, gathering rocks, and pieces of iron. 
      He formulates a plan of integration for these items and mixes 
      them with plants and local foliage, adding a solar power source and 
      pump and creates beautiful meaningful pieces. 
      
      He started creating custom designs in 2022 during time at home during
      the pandemic shutdown and his vision has expanded to include custom 
      sculptures of various beloved pets and shapes that are of interest. 
      He has built fountains for others as part of a collaborative effort 
      to share beautiful water features that are personalized and would now
      like to extend this service to new customers.
